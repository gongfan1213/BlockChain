This section details the design and implementation specifics of the mini blockchain system, including the workflow of core algorithms, design of key data structures, and interaction relationships between modules.

### 4.1 Core Data Structure Design

#### 4.1.1 Account Structure

The account structure uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with NIST P-256 curve for key generation. Main attributes include:

```python
class BlockchainAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.private_key: SigningKey  # Private key for transaction signing
        self.public_key: VerifyingKey  # Public key for signature verification
        
    @property
    def address(self) -> str:
        # Generate address from public key (128-character hex string)
        return self.public_key.to_string().hex()
```

#### 4.1.2 Transaction Structure

Implements a single-input single-output (SISO) transaction model with the following fields:

```python
@dataclass
class Transaction:
    sender: str      # Sender address
    receiver: str    # Receiver address
    amount: int      # Transaction amount
    signature: bytes # Transaction signature
    
    @property
    def txid(self) -> str:
        # Generate transaction ID using SHA-256
        data = f"{self.sender}{self.receiver}{self.amount}".encode()
        return sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

#### 4.1.3 Block Structure

The block structure consists of block header and block body:

```python
class Block:
    def __init__(self, index: int, previous_hash: str,
                 transactions: List[Transaction], difficulty: int):
        # Block header
        self.index = index          # Block height
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash  # Previous block hash
        self.timestamp = time.time() # Timestamp
        self.difficulty = difficulty # Difficulty target
        self.nonce = 0              # Nonce (for mining)
        
        # Block body
        self.transactions = transactions    # Transaction list
        self.merkle_root = self._calculate_merkle_root() # Merkle tree root
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()   # Block hash
```

#### 4.1.4 Merkle Tree Structure

Tree data structure for efficient transaction verification:

```python
class MerkleTree:
    def __init__(self, transactions: List[str]):
        self.transactions = transactions  # List of transaction IDs
        self.tree = self.build_tree(transactions)  # Tree structure
        
    @property
    def root_hash(self) -> str:
        # Get root hash value
        return self.tree[-1][0] if self.tree else ""
```

### 4.2 Core Algorithm Implementation

Account creation process:

1. Generate elliptic curve key pair
   ```python
   # Generate key pair using NIST P-256 curve
   private_key = SigningKey.generate(curve=NIST256p)
   public_key = private_key.get_verifying_key()
   ```

2. Address generation
   ```python
   # Convert public key to hex string as address
   address = public_key.to_string().hex()
   ```

3. Transaction signing
   ```python
   # Sign transaction data with private key
   signature = private_key.sign(transaction_data)
   ```

#### 4.2.2 Transaction Processing Flow

   ```python
   def create_transaction(sender: BlockchainAccount,
                         receiver_address: str, amount: int):
       # Generate transaction signature
       signature = sender.sign_transaction(f"{amount}".encode())
       
       # Create new transaction
       return Transaction(
           sender=sender.address,
           receiver=receiver_address,
           amount=amount,
           signature=signature
       )
   ```

2. Transaction verification
   ```python
   def validate(self) -> bool:
       # Verify signature using sender's public key
       return BlockchainAccount.verify_signature(
           self.sender,
           self.signature,
           f"{self.amount}".encode()
       )
   ```

#### 4.2.3 Merkle Tree Construction Algorithm

1. Build tree structure
   ```python
   def build_tree(self, nodes: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
       tree = [nodes]
       while len(nodes) > 1:
           new_level = []
           # Pairwise hash computation
           for i in range(0, len(nodes), 2):
               left = nodes[i]
               right = nodes[i+1] if i+1 < len(nodes) else left
               new_level.append(hash_pair(left, right))
           tree.append(new_level)
           nodes = new_level
       return tree
   ```

2. Generate Merkle proof
   ```python
   def get_proof(self, index: int) -> List[str]:
       proof = []
       current_level = 0
       current_index = index
       
       while current_level < len(self.tree)-1:
           # Get sibling node hash
           sibling_index = current_index + 1 if current_index % 2 == 0 else current_index - 1
           if sibling_index < len(self.tree[current_level]):
               proof.append(self.tree[current_level][sibling_index])
           current_index = current_index // 2
           current_level += 1
       
       return proof
   ```

#### 4.2.4 Blockchain Construction and Mining Algorithm

1. Block creation
   ```python
   def add_block(self, transactions: List[Transaction]) -> bool:
       latest_block = self.get_latest_block()
       new_block = Block(
           index=latest_block.index + 1,
           previous_hash=latest_block.hash,
           transactions=transactions,
           difficulty=self.difficulty
       )
       # Perform mining
       new_block.mine()
       return True
   ```

2. Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining
   ```python
   def mine(self) -> None:
       while not self.is_valid_hash():
           self.nonce += 1
           self.hash = self.calculate_hash()
   
   def is_valid_hash(self) -> bool:
       # Verify if hash meets difficulty requirement
       return self.hash.startswith('0' * self.difficulty)
   ```
